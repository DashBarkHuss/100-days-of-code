# Post #100DaysOfCode Log - Dashiell Bark-Huss

I completed my 365 days of code in 2019. I logged my progress everyday. I continued to add to my [2020 log](https://github.com/DashBarkHuss/100-days-of-code/blob/master/post-log.md). This is my 2021 log.

## Sample Localizational/Internationalization project

I finished my sample [currency i18n](https://github.com/DashBarkHuss/currency_localization_react_express) project. It's a sample project that shows how to set the currency for a user depending on their language preference in their browser `accept-language` header.

I wanted to accommodate different currencies because some of my beta users asked me to. But there was little info on the subject. I figured it out and put this sample together so others can understand how it might be done.

## React Wasted Renders

My app was re-rendering too many times. React doesn't have a solution to figuring out what caused a component to update (if you know of a way let me know). There are some notes in my last log entry ([12-29-20](https://github.com/DashBarkHuss/100-days-of-code/blob/master/post-log.md#update-12-29-20)) for some clues on how to do this- profiler, memo, react dev tools. I didn't find that any were very good for seeing why a component rendered. For example, memo only shows what props caused a re-render but not state changes.

So I built my own function to figure out when props or state changed. It doesn't show you when a parent rerender caused a component to rerender but you can figure it out if you use the debugging function in the parent and see that the parent re-renders.

## My own react debugging function

This tells you if a component rendered and if the state or props changed.

It helped me figure out why I had so many re-renders. This function could be more DRY.

### useTraceUpdate

```javascript
import { useEffect, useRef } from "react";
import _ from "lodash";
/**
 * tracks component renders
 * @param {String} component component name ex: App.name
 * @param {Object} props
 * @param {Object} state
 */
export default function useTraceUpdate(component, props, state) {
  const prevP = useRef(props);
  const prevS = useRef(state);
  let render = useRef(0);
  useEffect(() => {
    render.current++;
    console.log(component, "rendered ", render.current, " times");
    if (props) {
      const changedProps = Object.entries(props).reduce((ps, [k, v]) => {
        if (prevP.current[k] !== v) {
          ps[k] = [prevP.current[k], v];
        }
        return ps;
      }, {});
      if (Object.keys(changedProps).length > 0) {
        const displayText = Object.entries(changedProps).map((s) =>
          typeof s[1][0] === "object" && typeof s[1][1] === "object"
            ? `${s[0]} object changed, content of object ${
                _.isEqual(s[1][0], s[1][1]) ? "didn't" : "did"
              }  change ${
                !_.isEqual(s[1][0], s[1][1])
                  ? `from ${s[1][0]} to ${s[1][1]}`
                  : ""
              }`
            : `${s[0]} changed from ${s[1][0]} \nto ${s[1][1]}`
        );
        console.log(
          "r:" + render.current + " info: " + component + " changed props:",
          displayText.join("\n")
        );
      }
    }
    prevP.current = props;
    if (state) {
      const changedState = Object.entries(state).reduce((ps, [k, v]) => {
        if (prevS.current[k] !== v) {
          ps[k] = [prevS.current[k], v];
        }
        return ps;
      }, {});
      if (Object.keys(changedState).length > 0) {
        const displayText = Object.entries(changedState).map((s) =>
          typeof s[1][0] === "object" && typeof s[1][1] === "object"
            ? `${s[0]} object changed, content of object ${
                _.isEqual(s[1][0], s[1][1]) ? "didn't" : "did"
              } change ${
                !_.isEqual(s[1][0], s[1][1])
                  ? `from ${s[1][0]} to ${s[1][1]}`
                  : ""
              }`
            : `${s[0]} changed from ${s[1][0]} \nto ${s[1][1]}`
        );
        console.log(
          "r:" + render.current + " " + component + " changed state:",
          displayText.join("\n")
        );
      }
    }
    if (render.current === 1) {
      console.log("r:" + render.current + ": initial render");
    }
    prevS.current = state;
  });
}
```

How to use `useTraceUpdate`:

```javascript
function WishlistPage(props) {
  const [alias, setAlias] = useState(null);
  const [wishlist, setWishlist] = useState(null);
  const [refreshWishlist, setRefreshWishlist] = useState(null);
  const currentUser = useContext(UserContext);

  const states = {
    alias,
    wishlist,
    refreshWishlist,
    currentUser,
  };

  useTraceUpdate(WishlistPage.name, props, states);

  return <div>... blablabla</div>;
}

export default WishlistPage;
```
